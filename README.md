# Image Segmentation: VR Headset and Controller

This project is an image segmentation model that detects and segments two classes: **VR Headset** and **Controller**. The model is trained using the YOLOv5 framework for object detection and segmentation tasks. This project is primarily for practice to understand and implement image segmentation techniques.

## Project Overview

This model segments images into two classes:
- **VR Headset**
- **Controller**

It can identify and separate these objects from background and other irrelevant elements in the image.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `ultralytics` (for YOLOv8 model)
- `torch` (PyTorch)



To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python matplotlib torch
